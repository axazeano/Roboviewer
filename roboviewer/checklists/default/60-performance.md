Check the changes for obvious performance problems.

What to look at:
- A query or an expensive computation inside a loop where one call would do.
- An algorithm quadratic in collection size, on data that can grow.
- Synchronous I/O, decoding or parsing on the main thread.
- Work on a hot path: in cell rendering, in a scroll handler, in the body of a frequently called callback.
- Needless copies of large collections, expensive objects recreated on every call.
- A leaked resource: an unclosed file, connection, timer or observer.
- A cache that grows without a bound.

Only write a finding where the scale of the problem is visible: a loop over
three elements does not need optimising. If the data size is not obvious, use
`grep` to see where the data comes from.

The check is done when every loop, allocation and repeated call the diff
introduces has been sized once against the data that reaches it. If the change
adds no repeated work and no allocation on anything that can grow, say so and
submit.
