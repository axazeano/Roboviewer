Check how the changed code deals with errors.

What to look at:
- Swallowed errors: an empty catch, `try?` with no handling, logging instead of reacting.
- An error handled so that the user is left hanging: the spinner never stops, the screen stays empty with no explanation.
- Network and disk operations with no failure or timeout handling.
- Error context lost on rewrapping — `unknown error` reaches the surface.
- Partially changed state: the first operation succeeded, the second failed, nothing was rolled back.
- Error handling added on one path but skipped on the identical one next to it.

Tell a deliberately ignored error (there is a comment, the error really does not
matter) from a forgotten one. The first is not a finding.
